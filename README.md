## SUMMARY
## High-level Summary
From the analysis conducted, the demographic shows a large male population, as well as a high volume of use during peak hours (M-F work hours). This indicates that there is likely to be a high demand for the bikes in Des Moines, and as such - the project has high chances of being successful. Identifying and targeting the right demographic will go a long way in helping to implement strategy to assure favorable outcomes.

## Additional Visualizations
Two additional visualizations are:

• An analysis of the weather/precipitation in the target city to evaluate how the weather will affect demand.

• Analysis incorporating price per bike rental into visualizations to see how bike rental demand directly translates to profit.
